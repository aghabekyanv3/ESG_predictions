# ESG Data Analysis and Clustering Project

## Overview

This project entails a comprehensive data analysis, focusing initially on clustering methodologies to uncover inherent groupings within the ESG dataset. After an extensive initial analysis, I decided to revisit and overhaul the entire analysis process to enhance the insights and outcomes derived from the data.

## Updates

The project is currently undergoing updates to refine the analysis further and incorporate additional data processing techniques. This iterative process is aimed at improving the accuracy and relevance of the clustering results, ensuring the findings are robust and actionable.

## Initial Clustering

The initial phase of the project involved clustering using the `KMeans` algorithm from Scikit-learn, supported by text data processing with `TfidfVectorizer`. This approach aimed to identify meaningful patterns and groupings within the data, providing a preliminary understanding of the underlying structures.

## Refined Analysis

Recognizing the potential for deeper insights, I have embarked on a comprehensive reevaluation of the dataset and prediction techniques. For this I have used optuna for hyperparameter tuning and various classification algorithms (to predict which cluster a company with certain characteristics would belong to).
